# Tracking Inventory program


This project is a simple app for tracking orders and inventory. The program is pretty simple where we have 4 functions, these functions are view, insert, update,
and delete. The information provided for each order are name, tracking number, Date and time, destination, and status. The information are store in dictionary-map 
(i.e eventually .json file). the .json file will be our database where we will read and write to it. Once we read the .json file, we will be able to do the 4 functions
mentioned earlier.

Simply to run the program, just click on run in replit and you should see that
